# warp

a clean, simple, customizable wrapper for Docker and its ecosystem.

### 50-100 word summary for 2015 Docker hackathon

`warp` is a simple wrapper for the Docker ecosystem. One stop shop to install, update, and interact with `docker`, `machine`, `compose`, etc. 

Provides capability to dynamically load functions and namespaces from your own helper scripts or convenience functions. Allows for theme support to customize color handling and screen size, including a truncate as well as a line wrap mode.

`warp` has extremely minimal system dependencies (almost 100% `bash`), so it will work as-is on a variety of vanilla and minimal operating systems without extra language support needed, including OS X and Ubuntu.

### Screenshots

##### Example of wrapping and truncation of output to accomodate different screen sizes. Ever presented docker on a screen with low resolution or tried to use it from your phone? This will help.
